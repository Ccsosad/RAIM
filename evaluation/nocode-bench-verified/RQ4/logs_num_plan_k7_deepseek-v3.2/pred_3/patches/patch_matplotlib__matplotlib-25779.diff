+==========================================
+Adding an arrow to an ellipse with vertices
+==========================================
+
+This example shows how to add an arrow to an ellipse to indicate rotation
+direction. The arrow is placed exactly on the ellipse by using the coordinates
+of the vertices obtained via `Ellipse.get_vertices()`.
+
+The example creates an ellipse, computes its vertices, and then draws an arrow
+from one vertex to the other. This can be used to indicate clockwise or
+counter-clockwise rotation.

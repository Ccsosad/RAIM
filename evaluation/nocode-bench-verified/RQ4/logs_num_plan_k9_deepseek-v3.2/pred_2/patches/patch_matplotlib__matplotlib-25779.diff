+Ellipse with arrow indicating rotation
+===================================
+
+This example shows how to add an arrow to an ellipse to indicate its rotation
+direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). The arrow is placed exactly on the
+ellipse using the coordinates of the vertices obtained via `get_vertices()`.

     Random displacement of marks along either or both axes to reduce overplotting.

+    ----------
+    width : float
+        Amount of jitter relative to the mark width along the orientation axis.
+        The default is 0.2, which applies a small amount of jitter.
+    x : float
+        Amount of jitter in data units along the x axis.
+    y : float
+        Amount of jitter in data units along the y axis.
+    seed : int, optional
+        Random seed for reproducible jitter.
